Android Geo Location example app

** Intro
In order to get the proximity alarm to fire there must be a change in latitude
and longitude from the user. In other words, it must come from a result of the
LocationListener interface. That being said, you must send initial coordinates
via DDMS to find your location, and then change it in order for the proximity
alarm to sound. 

** Instructions (emulator)
- Send coordinates to the emulator via DDMS (see below).
- Launch the app.
- Drop a pin suitably close to your location.
- Send coordinates that are slightly different.

** Instructions (device)
- Ensure not in airplane mode.
- Launch app.
- Drop pin.
- Move around!

** Sending mock coordinates via DDMS
- In eclipse go Window -> Open Perspective -> DDMS -> emulator control -> location controls -> manual
- Enter a latitude and longitude. (ie: 47.6741667 and -122.1202778) 
- Hit send.

** Obtain a debug Google Maps API key
-Generate a debug MD5 fingerprint:
http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html#getdebugfingerprint

-Generate an API key with that fingerprint:

-Once obtained, enter it into the MapView in main.xml. Located at root/res/layout/main.xml. 
From there, enter in the api key in the android:apiKey="" attribute.
